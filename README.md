# Sales Funnel Optimization using Reinforcement Learning (Deep Q-Learning)

### **Overview**
This project demonstrates the use of reinforcement learning to optimize lead engagement and conversion in a multi-stage sales funnel. By applying a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**, the model learns the best actions to take for different types of leads, maximizing their progression through the sales funnel and improving overall conversion rates.

### **Key Features**
- **Reinforcement Learning Framework:** Utilizes a Deep Q-Learning algorithm to model and optimize decision-making in the sales funnel.
- **State Representation:** Captures the lead's current `EngagementScore` and `FunnelStage` to represent their status in the funnel.
- **Action Space:** Three dynamic engagement strategies:
  1. Sending an Educational Email.
  2. Inviting the lead to a Webinar or Demo.
  3. Setting up a Call with a Specialist.
- **Reward Mechanism:** Rewards the agent based on the increase in `EngagementScore`, with a terminal state when the score reaches 1.0 (maximum engagement).

### **How It Works**
1. **State Representation:**
   - Each lead is represented by two features:
     - `EngagementScore`: A normalized value (0 to 1) indicating the lead’s current interest level.
     - `FunnelStage`: Encodes the lead’s position in the sales process (Cold, Warm, Hot).

2. **Action Selection:**
   - The model uses an **ε-greedy policy** to balance exploration (random actions) and exploitation (best-known actions based on Q-values).

3. **Reward System:**
   - A reward is calculated based on the improvement in the `EngagementScore` after applying an action. A high `EngagementScore` (≥ 1.0) ends the episode.

4. **Deep Q-Learning:**
   - The Q-value function is approximated using a neural network:
     - Input: Current state (EngagementScore, FunnelStage).
     - Output: Q-values for all possible actions.
   - The model learns through experience replay, minimizing the mean squared error between predicted Q-values and target Q-values computed via the Bellman equation.

5. **Environment Interaction:**
   - The agent interacts with a simulated sales funnel environment, choosing actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards.

### **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks:**
  - **Reinforcement Learning:** TensorFlow, NumPy
  - **Data Handling:** pandas
  - **Simulation and Randomization:** random, collections (deque)
- **Deployment Frameworks:** The model can be extended for real-time dashboards using tools like Streamlit.

### **Results**
- **Engagement Improvement:** Leads are progressively moved through the funnel with actions tailored to their current state.
- **Learning Efficiency:** The model efficiently learns optimal strategies by balancing exploration and exploitation.

### **Future Enhancements**
- **Incorporate Dynamic Weights:** Replace the random engagement increases with data-driven weights for each action.
- **Adaptive Exploration:** Use advanced strategies like Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) for smarter exploration.
- **Feedback Loops:** Allow the model to incorporate real-time feedback from actual user interactions.

### **How to Use**
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sales-funnel-optimization.git
   cd sales-funnel-optimization
   ```
